# WordPress for Web Apps

A plugin that provides the essential components you need to power your web app with WordPress.

* Front-end login, sign-up, password reset, and password change forms.
* A delete account button for the front-end.
* Separate navigation menus for logged-in and logged-out users.
* User access settings, so you can selectively hide content from logged-out (or logged-in) users.
* Security settings let you set password requirements, hide the admin bar, and block backend access.
* The web app settings panel lets you easily configure error messages, button text, and more.
