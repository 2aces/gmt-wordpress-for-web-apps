**Version: 2.3**

* A plugin that replaces the WordPress version of jQuery with the lastest Google-hosted version.

## What's Missing?
Styling. The Web App Start Kit contains the PHP snippets and basic HTML to get a web app up and running on WordPress.

Tailor the look and feel to fit your design.

## How It Works
There are two types of files included: Template and Plugins.

Templates are PHP files you can include in your theme and assign to specific pages. The forms and buttons are all templates.

Plugins get uploaded to your plugin directory and add additional functionality to WordPress.

## Why did you make this?
Last year I started working on a project to create a mobile learning app. I didn't have any experience with backend development, so I decided to see if I could use WordPress to power the app (and save me from having to develop something).

After two weeks of experimenting, I had a simple but working web app.

There wasn’t a one-stop shop for all of the stuff I wanted to build in. I had a lot of help from various websites, most notably Stock Overflow, along the way. I put together this starter kit to help others get their projects off the ground more quickly.
